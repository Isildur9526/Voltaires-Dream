#Mediatization Incident
 incident_mediatization.1.t: "The Question of Mediatization"
 incident_mediatization.1.d: "The Holy Roman Empire has always been much less a centralized state than it has been a conglomeration of Prince-Bishoprics, Free Cities, Principalities, Duchies and Kingdoms alike. Due to the progressive reduction of imperial authority over the preceding centuries, the Theocracies and Free Cities have more or less been allowed to thrive despite a number of conflicts with the more expansionist monarchical states, and have retained their ancient privileges dating back hundreds of years while refusing to accept integration.\n\nHowever, radical changes to the Empire's structure are on the horizon, and ones largely of our own making. As we have expanded further and further into the Empire's borders, the question of how to compensate the dispossessed secular rulers of territory we have seized has become increasingly pressing. Giving the lands back and thereby compromising ourselves would be unacceptable to us; therefore, we must convince the Emperor that secularization of all Theocracies and mediatization of all Free Cities is the only option to preserve the Empire."

 incident_mediatization.2.t: "Mediatization on the Horizon?"
 incident_mediatization.2.da: "As a Theocracy, our position in the Holy Roman Empire has been very tenuous as of late due to conflicts with the secular states seeking to annex our lands. Our saving grace, however, has been the lavish privileges conferred on us by the Emperor in centuries past guaranteeing our rights.\nYet now, our whole territorial integrity looks to be undone with outrageous demands from [med_demander.GetName] being pushed on the Emperor to secularize all Theocracies in the Empire!"
 incident_mediatization.2.db: "As a Free City, our position in the Holy Roman Empire has been very tenuous as of late due to conflicts with the secular states seeking to annex our lands. Our saving grace, however, has been the lavish privileges conferred on us by the Emperor in centuries past guaranteeing our rights.\nYet now, our whole territorial integrity looks to be undone with outrageous demands from [med_demander.GetName] being pushed on the Emperor to mediatize all Free Cities in the Empire!"

 incident_mediatization.3.d: "The Holy Roman Empire has always been much less a centralized state than it has been a conglomeration of Prince-Bishoprics, Free Cities, Principalities, Duchies and Kingdoms alike. Due to the progressive reduction of imperial authority over the preceding centuries, the Theocracies and Free Cities have more or less been allowed to thrive despite a number of conflicts with the more expansionist monarchical states, and have retained their ancient privileges dating back hundreds of years while refusing to accept integration.\n\nHowever, radical changes appear to be on the horizon as we has failed to stop the expansionist ambitions of [med_demander.GetName], whose conquests have deprived many former secular states of their lands. Now, a [med_demander.GetAdjectiveCap] delegation has sent harsh demands to us, outrageously demanding that the Theocracies and Free Cities of the Empire be completely abolished and annexed to the dispossessed secular princes as compensation!"

 incident_mediatization.4.d: "The Holy Roman Mediatization has begun, and the worst of our fears have finally been realized as more surrounding Theocracies are dismembered and abolished by the day.
