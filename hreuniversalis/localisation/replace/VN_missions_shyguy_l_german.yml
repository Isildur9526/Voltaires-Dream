Confident that the Bulgars would surrender quickly due to the weakness of their fragmenting state, the Mongol host gave pursuit to a small Bulgar army. Unbeknownst to the Mongols, the Bulgars had planned an ambush. Once the Mongols had been lured deep into Bulgar territory, hidden Bulgar troops appeared from all sides and slayed almost the entire Mongol army."

#Taifa RELs
 vn_missions.1.t: "Wiederherstellung des Kalifats von Córdoba"
 vn_missions.1.d: "Der Kalif von Córdoba regierte fast 100 Jahre lang den größten Teil der iberischen Halbinsel, bis er 1031 durch interne Machtkämpfe entmachtet wurde. Das friedliche Zusammenleben verschiedener Völker unter einem Regenten machte es zur ersten Hochkultur des mittelalterlichen Europas neben Byzanz. Mit unserem zunehmenden Einfluss auf die muslimische Welt kann [Root.GetMunserunsere] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] sich selbst zum Kalifen, dem Oberhaupt des [Root.Religion.GetName]en Islam, ernennen."
 vn_missions.1.a: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] ist wahrhaftig der Nachfolger von Prophet Mohammed"
 vn_missions.1.b: "Niemand ist würdig, diesen Titel zu tragen"
#Florence
 vn_missions.2.t: "New Stocking of our Libraries"
 vn_missions.2.d: "For centuries, our books collections and libraries have provided our scholars, scientists and advisors with vast amounts of ancient and modern knowledge, driving them to new accomplishments. Thanks to the book printing that is now spread throughout Europe, it is possible for us to reproduce this knowledge with little effort. The possibilities are endless, but we have to decide which books to print first."
 vn_missions.2.a: "Philosophy has always fascinated us"
 vn_missions.2.b: "We can improve our diplomatic skills by learning from Roman statesmen"
 vn_missions.2.c: "Let us look ahead and explore modern warfare"
#Apulia
 vn_missions.3.t: "Sicilians under Foreign Rule"
 vn_missions.3.d: "For decades we have ruled over Italians, but our nobility and clergy largely remained of Norman culture. We are united in faith, but the cultural differences are tremendous, which constantly leads to tensions with the common people. To tackle this problem, we could try to spread our culture among the rural population as well, so that they slowly accept it and give up their own. Alternatively, we could abandon Norman customs and embrace Sicilian culture as primary culture."
 vn_missions.3.a: "Spread Norman culture intensively"
 vn_missions.3.b: "The days we used to call ourselves Norman are over"
#Latin Empire
 vn_missions.4.t: "Demands of the Venetians"
 vn_missions.4.d: "After the successful but costly crusade, our treasuries are strained and the Venetians demand reparations from us, although we have been their allies! We cannot afford to squeeze our scarce funds to greedy Doges, yet our advisors have proposed a solution to this. By stealing and melting down relics from Orthodox churches, we will be able to improve our financial situation and pay the Venetians. This would, however, make the Greeks dislike us even more than they already do."
 vn_missions.4.a: "Melt them down and turn them into money!"
 vn_missions.4.b: "The Venetians shall curb their greed!"
#Morocco
 vn_missions.5.t: "A New Caliphate!"
 vn_missions.5.d: "The destruction of the Fatimid caliphate and the conquest of Cairo by the Moroccan troops has not only stirred up the Muslim world. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] was due to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] recent accomplishments crowned as new Caliph of [Root.Religion.GetName] Islam by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors, thus stepping into the footprints of Prophet Mohammad himself. The ambitious, mighty and faithful Empire of Islam stretching from al-Andalus to Egypt, born of descent from the caliphs of old pledges is to fight for the future of the peoples of Islam as a whole."
 vn_missions.5.a: "Let the infidels tremble!"
#Genoa
 vn_missions.6.t: "The Purchase of Chios"
 vn_missions.6.d: "Thanks to our excellent relations with [2341.owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [2341.owner.Monarch.GetName] [2341.owner.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] in recent years causing our two nations to prosper, we have received a particularly promising offer: Due to their richness, the Aegean islands are often attacked by pirates, which is why [2341.owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [2341.owner.Monarch.GetName] has proposed the sale of the island of Chios to let us take care of its defence. We will be able to use it as a naval base, which will make it easier to perform own military operations in the future, but also as a trading hub, increasing our trade influence there.\nDo we want to be appointed commander of this island?"
 vn_missions.6.a: "Give them the money they demand"
 vn_missions.6.b: "Cancel the negotiations"
#Nicea/Epirus/Trebizond
 vn_missions.7.t: "The Reconquest of Constantinople"
 vn_missions.7.d: "For centuries, Constantinople, the Queen of all Cities, has been the center of Western culture, science and trade. Temporarily, hundreds of thousands of people lived in the metropolis, protected by the strongest city walls of the known world. It was not until the momentous Fourth Crusade that the city was for the first time expropriated from Greek hands; the Eastern Roman Empire was considered to have perished. However, thanks to our masterful diplomacy and successful campaigns, we were able to recapture the city that had once been regarded as impregnable. Now we have the choice to return to Constantinople and legitimize our rightful claim to the Roman heritage."
 vn_missions.7.a: "It is time for us to revert to Constantinople"
 vn_missions.7.b: "[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is better suited as a capital for our ambitions"
#Teutonic Order
 vn_missions.8.t: "The Foundation of Königsberg"
 vn_missions.8.d: "Thanks to the urbanization of the estuaries of the Mottlau, Nogat and Pregel rivers, these regions have become a magnet for domestic and foreign settlers and traders. Especially the city of Königsberg has rapidly grown from an insignificant village to a center for economy and trade. As a result, it could be a better place to rule than our current capital."
 vn_missions.8.a: "Move our seat to Königsberg"
 vn_missions.8.b: "Rather invest in [Root.Capital.GetName]"
#Byzantium
 vn_missions.12.t: "Regnum Bospori"
 vn_missions.12.d: "Thanks to successful campaigns in recent years, we were able to claim the other side of the Black Sea coast for ourselves. Since this region was already ruled by a Roman client state in Roman times, the question now arises whether we should relinquish the local administration in order to focus our attention on other regions of our Empire."
 vn_missions.12.a: "Appoint a viceroy"
 vn_missions.12.b: "We do not need a client state"
#Sardinia
 vn_missions.14.t: "Regnum Sardiniae et Corsicae"
 vn_missions.14.d: "In the year of our Lord, [GetYear], the Pope has come to a decision regarding the fate of Sardinia. Thanks to our diligent guidance, he has come to make a wise choice: the duchy of Sardinia shall be ruled by its natives and its natives alone, and [Root.Monarch.GetName], duke of Sardinia and Corsica, shall be their ruler."
 vn_missions.14.a: "Excellent news!"
#Sardinia-Piedmont
 vn_missions.15.t: "The Papal States evicted from Romagna!"
 vn_missions.15.d: "Has the Lord forsaken us? Today, in the year $YEAR$, the armies of [From.GetName], devil's kith and kin, have overrun our rightful territories in Romagna. While we will without any doubt effortlessly take it back from those brutes, this will greatly affect our diplomatic reputation."
 vn_missions.15.a: "Infidels!"
#Georgia
 vn_missions.16.t: "The Future of the Armenian Church"
 vn_missions.16.d: "The Armenians have always been adherents of Miaphysite Christianity, which split off from the rest of Christianity in the 5th century. Consequently, the important question now arises as to how we will deal with these alleged heretics in our conquered territories.\nAn option might be to keep the Armenian Apostolic Church as an equal institution in our state and allow the Armenians to continue to practise their faith. Alternatively, we will opt for a much more radical course, namely the dissolution of the Armenian Church to enable the [Root.GetAdjective] Church to put out its feelers to Armenia, which will certainly cause unrest among our Armenian subjects though. With sufficient finesse, we might instead strike a balance by slowly starting to integrate the Armenian ecclesiastical institutions into our own, thereby merging the two Churches in the long run. What do we choose, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 vn_missions.16.a: "Maintain an independent Armenian Apostolic Church"
 vn_missions.16.b: "Extend the influence of the [Root.GetAdjective] Church"
 vn_missions.16.c: "Strive for integration into the [Root.GetAdjective] Church"
 vn_missions.16.a.tt: "Every owned province with §YArmenian§! culture gets '§YArmenian Church Preserved§!' for §Y30 years§!, giving the following effects:\nLocal Institution Spread: §G+20.0%§!\nLocal Tax Modifier: §G+15.0%§!\nLocal Missionary Strength: §R-2.0%§!"

#Cologne
 vn_missions.17.t: "New Electoral Residence?"
 vn_missions.17.d: "The patricians of Cologne are disturbed by the duties and taxes that we levy on the roads and streets along the Rhine. Since our secular possessions now extend far beyond the banks of the Rhine, we could expand a more distant city into a new residential city. In this way, we will shift our political and economic focus in order to weaken the rebellious people of Cologne."
 vn_missions.17.a: "It is not far from Cologne to Bonn"
 vn_missions.17.b: "Arnsberg is a lovely town, isn't it?"
 vn_missions.17.c: "We do not need a new capital"
 vn_missions.18.c: "[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is my favourite as a matter of course"
 vn_missions.18.t: "The Shrine of the Three Kings"
 vn_missions.18.d: "Thanks to our great political importance in the Holy Roman Empire, the Emperor has given us a magnificent gift: the Bones of the Three Magi. These unique relics will certainly attract thousands of pilgrims to Cologne to praise the Lord every .\nOur advisors are sure that our old Cathedral will not be able to handle these expected crowds. Let us therefore begin with the construction of a new Cathedral, which will surpass all previous church towers by far and will demonstrate our unlimited prestige!"
 vn_missions.18.a: "Lay the foundation of a new Cathedral"
#Venice
 vn_missions.21.t: "Carta Concessionis"
 vn_missions.21.d: "To secure Venetian control of the distant island of Crete, we should consider distributing it to Venetian knights and burghers who will be led by a feudal duke. This would not only allow us to keep the local population in check, but also to promote the development of the island and our trade influence in the eastern Mediterranean Sea."
 vn_missions.21.a: "Assign the island to a duke"
 vn_missions.21.b: "We keep control of Crete ourselves"
#Qahira
 vn_missions.22.t: "[Root.GetAdjective] Resistance"
 vn_missions.22.d: "The Mongolian Empire is expanding uncontrollably to the west, and no army, no general has ever been able to stop those fierce horsemen. However, the great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] has sworn not to leave [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] subjects to the Mongols without resistance - something dozens of other rulers have desperately failed to achieve before.\nWe know exactly that the dreaded warriors of the Mongols are marching towards [Root.Capital.GetName] at that very moment, scorching every village and farm they meet as well as robbing, raping and slaughtering our people on their way. The coming battles might appear to be hopeless, but at the same time we know that only we have the chance to vanquish the nimbus of Mongolian Invincibility!"
 vn_missions.22.a: "To arms!"
#Toulouse
 vn_missions.23.t: "Principality of Toulouse"
 vn_missions.23.d: "The French Kings often tried to restrict the autonomy of the Occitan rulers in the past and to bind them more closely to the French Crown. Because of the weakness of the French King, we were able to maintain our de facto independence and even claim other counties of the region for ourselves. The influence of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has now grown to such an extent that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can easily compete with the French King for supremacy in southern France and beyond. Because of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] accomplishments, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has crowned [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] Prince of [Root.GetName]."
 vn_missions.23.a: "The French Crown will soon be ours, too!"
 vn_missions.24.t: "Catharism in Toulouse"
 vn_missions.24.d: "After [PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [PAP.Monarch.GetName] has ostracized the Cathars at the Third Council of the Lateran, all dutiful Christian rulers are called upon to take decisive action against heresies. Also in our realm the Cathar heresy has spread quite fast in recent years. By now it has met with great approval among peasantry, nobility and even clergy. If we want to exterminate the Cathars, we will thus have to take action against the majority of our subjects. This would certainly devastate and weaken our country for generations, but the Pope would encourage our efforts."
 vn_missions.24.a: "As long as they are Christians, we will not prosecute them"
 vn_missions.24.b: "They are obviously heretics and must burn at the stake!"
 vn_missions.24.c: "Expel all inquisitors and encourage this new religion!"
#Swabia
 vn_missions.25.t: "Hoffest of Mainz"
 vn_missions.25.d: "Thanks to our recent political and military successes, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] has called for a court festival. Within a few weeks, a veritable city of tents and wooden buildings, dominated by an impressive palace and church, was erected in Mainz, a central city in the Kingdom of Germany. Nobles and clergymen flocked to Mainz from Germany, France, Spain, England and Italy in order not to miss the coming spectacles. After a sumptuous banquet, which did not only offer local dishes but also culinary specialities from far exotic places, the youngest offsprings of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] were accoladed, thus securing the succession of [Root.GetName]. This was followed by a riding event where the best knights of the continent could demonstrate their skills in swinging lances, banners and shields. While the guests were enjoying for days, the most important rulers of Europe fulfilled their political duties by breaking or concluding treaties.\nThis opulent festival will be remembered for decades to come, illustrating [Root.GetName]'s glorious prestige!"
 vn_missions.25.a: "Splendid!"
#Poland
 vn_missions.26.t: "A Dukedom in Prussia?"
 vn_missions.26.d: "The subjugation of Prussia raises the question of how we want to organize the administration and government of the region. The long coastline, with its shipyards and trading posts, would certainly benefit the [Root.GetAdjective] Crown if it was directly under its control, but we might prefer to invest our capacity in more important parts of the [Root.GovernmentName]."
 vn_missions.26.a: "Appoint a Prussian duke"
 vn_missions.26.b: "Keep the territories for ourselves"
#Lithuania
 vn_missions.27.t: "Christian Missionaries"
 vn_missions.27.d: "The Lithuanian tribes have always trusted in their own pantheon of gods, led by Perkunas, the God of Thunder. In recent years, however, strange missionaries have come to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] several times, where they have tried to convert our people to their faith - Christianity. They believe in Jesus Christ, whose sacrificial and holy deeds are written down in a Holy Book called 'Bible'. After Jesus had been crucified as the alleged 'King of the Jews', he is said to have risen from the dead, whereupon Christianity became the predominant religion in Europe in the following centuries.\n\nWith the unification of the Lithuanians and the establishment of our own duchy, our Christian neighbours have shown an enhanced interest in us. We have already heard of the stories of the so-called Crusades - Holy Wars - which Christians waged against pagans in order to force them to convert. Perhaps we will also have to fight against the Christians if we continue to refuse to adopt Christianity."
 vn_missions.27.a: "Hire a Catholic bishop to baptize [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 vn_missions.27.b: "Hire an Orthodox bishop to baptize [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 vn_missions.27.c: "Imprison all foreign missionaries!"
#Poland & Lithuania
 vn_missions.28.t: "Cossacks of Zaporozhie"
 vn_missions.28.d: "We control large parts of the sparsely populated Ruthenia only loosely, which is often raided by Turkmen plunderers from the eastern steppes. In order to protect the region against these assaults and to colonize it, we should consider transferring these lands to the Cossacks who live in our [Root.GovernmentName]. These 'free men' are experienced steppe warriors, who have often supported us in military matters, but are a headstrong people in their own right. However, if we can secure their loyalty, they will surely emerge as powerful subjects and allies."
 vn_missions.28.a: "Entrust them with autonomous governance of the region"
 vn_missions.28.b: "Leave it to us and keep them under our wings"
#Commonwealth
 vn_missions.29.t: "Paradisus Judaeorum"
 vn_missions.29.d: "The history of Judaism in Poland dates back to the 10th century, when Jewish merchants regularly visited Polish cities via trade routes and later settled in them. The religious intolerance caused by the Crusades brought many Jews from France, Germany or Spain to Poland, where the Polish kings offered them protection. Boleslaw III recognized the utility of Jews in the development of the commercial interests of his country, turning them into the backbone of Polish economy. Jews also worked as engravers and technical supervisors at the Polish court, enjoying undisturbed peace and prosperity.\n\nWe could continue this tolerant policy of our successors by allowing the establishment of a new autonomous Jewish community in the city of [new_jewish_community.GetName]. In return for their religious freedoms and privileges, we will certainly benefit from their ingenuity by allowing them to collect taxes and provide education in that province. How do we decide this time, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 vn_missions.29.a: "Establish a new Qahal in [new_jewish_community.GetName]"
 vn_missions.29.b: "Maybe another time"
 vn_missions.29.tt: "There will be another opportunity to establish a new Jewish Community in 20 years."
#Worms
 vn_missions.30.t: "Completion of Speyer Cathedral"
 vn_missions.30.d: "In the early 11th century, the former Salian Emperor Conrad II commissioned the construction of a majestic cathedral in Speyer, which is to tower above all the churches built to date. Such a prestigious undertaking requires decades of work, hundreds of architects and builders, as well as enormous amounts of money and building materials.\nWe are proud to announce that the final construction phase of the Speyer Cathedral has been completed under [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The outstanding splendour and glory of this Christian monument will cause the princes and bishops of the Empire to go green with envy. Even the Pope himself will be stunned and impressed by this incredible demonstration of power.\nShould we organize a new consecration appropriate to the dimensions of the impressive Cathedral?"
 vn_missions.30.a: "Ask the Pope for a consecration"
 vn_missions.30.b: "Ask a bishop for a consecration"
 vn_missions.30.c: "We do not need a new consecration"
#Kiev
 vn_missions.31.t: "Military Assistance for [From.GetName]"
 vn_missions.31.d: "On their gigantic conquest from their vast homeland in the east to the borders of Europe, the Mongolian steppe riders have made themselves a notorious reputation. It is said that whole metropolises were conquered by them within a few days only, leaving the city in ruins. At the same time, no known army was able to achieve a victory against the Mongolian forces, which often ended in a wild slaughter of the defeated troops.\nToday, we received a hasty legation from [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName], against whom the Mongols are currently launching an invasion. They are desperately asking us for military support, as they hope that this will give them a better chance to repel the Mongols.\nShould we comply with this request or leave them to their futile fate?"
 vn_missions.31.a: "It is our duty to help them!"
 vn_missions.31.b: "We'd like to help, but we can't"
 vn_missions.31.tt: "We send a diplomat back to Kiev informing them of our response."
 vn_missions.32.t: "[From.GetName] sends Assistance"
 vn_missions.32.d: "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the legation we have recently sent to the [From.GetAdjective] [From.Monarch.GetTitle] has returned to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] with good news: [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has responded to our urgent request to support us with military measures against the Mongol invaders by sending one of [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] best regiments, as [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] is very conscious of the danger the Mongols pose to [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] own [From.GovernmentName].\nMay these brave knights lead us to victory!"
 vn_missions.32.a: "We'd be lost without them"
 vn_missions.33.t: "[From.GetName] denies Assistance"
 vn_missions.33.d: "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the legation we have recently sent to the [From.GetAdjective] [From.Monarch.GetTitle] has returned to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] with unpleasant news: Despite the excellent negotiating skills and rhetoric of our diplomats, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] refused to support us with soldiers or at least financial means against the Mongolian hordes. We will not easily forget this political blunder unless we are able to survive the Mongolian invaders with integrity."
 vn_missions.33.a: "We did not see that coming"
#Saxony
 vn_missions.34.t: "Printing Press of Leipzig"
 vn_missions.34.d: "After Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press around 1440, the Lorraine merchantman Konrad Kachelofen founded one of the first printing houses of Europe in Leipzig. Starting in 1483 at the latest, he worked as a bookseller, publisher and printer until 1516. His printing works were extensive and varied in content, so he worked not only for the University of Leipzig but also for the diocese of Meissen. He printed the common theological and philosophical writings of medieval authors, contemporary humanists, as well as dictionaries and textbooks and classical texts of the great writers like Plato, Ovid and Seneca. Some German-language titles, such as the sermons of German priests, also originated from his office. Even after Kachelofen, the Leipzig book printing house continued to maintain an influential position in northern Germany, with mass production of Reformation literature, which eventually contributed to Lutheranism becoming the predominant religion in Saxony and beyond."
 vn_missions.34.a: "Great!"
#Austria
 vn_missions.35.t: "Our Religious Future"
 vn_missions.35.d: "The Reformation has not only divided [Root.GetName] into two rival factions of faith, but also the entire Holy Roman Empire, where Catholics, Protestants and other Christian heresies tried to gain the upper hand. In such times we cannot afford to pursue changeable religious policies. Therefore, we have to determine once and for all how [Root.GetName] should behave towards the different Christian denominations in the future, so that our nation can pursue a consistent foreign policy."
 vn_missions.35.a: "Our subjects are free to choose their faith themselves"
 vn_missions.35.b: "Rather rule a desert than a country full of heretics"
 vn_missions.36.t: "Privilegium Maius"
 vn_missions.36.d: "Unjustifiably, our splendid [Root.GovernmentName] has never received imperial privileges, including the electoral dignity. We are thus limited to the rank of a duchy, which, however, is not adequate for our outstanding prestige. Based on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] \nexemplary wisdom, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] had the brilliant idea of having the necessary documents of former Emperors forged, with which we could claim additional privileges from the Emperor. With these special rights, we will ascend to become the most powerful prince behind the Emperor and the seven Electors."
 vn_missions.36.a: "Austria is destined to rule the world"
 vn_missions.36.b: "Well, why don't we just elevate ourselves to an Archduchy?"
 vn_missions.37.t: "Viceroyalty of Lombardo-Venetia"
 vn_missions.37.d: "Our Empire has now grown to a gigantic scale, with [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] as the central figure and absolute ruler. However, many people in our possessions in Italy do not accept [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], demanding one of theirs as ruler of Italy.\nWe should consider putting our Italian territories under the rule of a viceroy or governor who keeps the Italian people at bay while we focus on other regions of our Empire."
 vn_missions.37.a: "A viceroy can better control the people there"
 vn_missions.37.b: "We prefer to rule Italy directly"

 vn_missions.38.d: "As of recently, large amounts of merchants, from both West and East, have been flocking to our newly-established trading hub, seeking a way to get around the monopoly Novgorod has on the fur trade. Novgorodian merchants have also arrived, seeking to control the waterways into their territory. Both factions are beginning to complain of increased competition, petitioning us to remove the others. Perhaps we could take advantage of this, and allow merchants we deem acceptable to stay, and those subversive to us to be prohibited."

 vn_missions.39.t: "Pope Callixtus II"
 vn_missions.39.d: "It was common practice in medieval Europe for fourth or fifth sons to join the Church. This was oftentimes their best option as they would have little or no chance to receive a significant inheritance. One of such cases was the fourth son of Count William I of Burgundy, Guy, who joined the Church and became Pope Callixtus II. As pope, he ended nearly 50 years of war between Rome and the Imperial crown in what became known as the Investiture Controversy. This was a disagreement between who could appoint bishops, the Church or the Empire. Callixtus compromised that clergymen would swear loyalty to the Emperor but would be appointed by the Church."
