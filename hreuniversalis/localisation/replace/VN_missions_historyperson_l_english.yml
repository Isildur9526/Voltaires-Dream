 vn_missions.200.d: "After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Charlemagne was the first Western European ruler to be crowned Emperor in 800, claiming the heritage of the Roman Emperors. With the coronation of Otto the Great, however, the Imperial Title has ceased to be in the hands of the once so great Carolingians. Instead, the German Kings have borne this coveted title, and have called themselves Holy Roman Emperors ever since.\nDue to our expansion into France, Lotharingia and Lombardy and the takeover of these regal titles, it is truly no longer adequate to call us a [Root.GovernmentName]. For this reason, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] travelled to Rome, where the Pope felt compelled to award [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] an Imperial Title. This will undoubtedly confirm our splendour, but it may cause an imbalance of power in Europe."

#Pavia
 vn_missions.300.t: "The Rebirth of Pavia"
 vn_missions.300.d: "From the 6th century to 774 Pavia was the capital of the Lombard Kingdom, whose control and power spanned throughout the Italian peninsula. After the kingdom's collapse at the hands of Charlemagne, the former political, social, and economic power of the city diminshed, despite Pavia remaining as the capital of the imperial Kingdom of Italy. In the pursuing political fragmentation consistent with the rest of Italy throughout the Middle Ages and beyond, Pavia, once the center of power in not only Lombardy but the entirety of Italy, became a self-governing commune, with authority only within the reaches of the city. But things changed in the 14th century. Under the dominion of its past rival Milan, Pavia was able to regain its past social power when the University of Pavia was founded. As the only university in the region for centuries, it the center of intellectual in Lombardy. The Certosa di Pavia was built, a monestary but also a marvel of architecture. If Pavia were able to muster political independence from the Milanese, time can only tell whether the city can regain its former might and glory."
