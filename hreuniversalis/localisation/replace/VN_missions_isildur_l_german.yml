#BURGUNDY
 vn_bur_stabilize_duchy_title: "Stabilisiert das Herzogtum"
 vn_bur_stabilize_duchy_desc: "Aufgrund von Erbfolgekriegen und mangelndem Willen der burgundischen Herzöge, ihre Kontrolle über die ungleichen Besitztümer des Herzogtums durchzusetzen, herrschte ein Zustand der Anarchie. Wir müssen jede sich bietende Gelegenheit ergreifen, um die herzogliche Macht zu stärken und zu verhindern, dass sich ein ähnliches Ereignis wiederholt."

 vn_bur_two_burgundies_desc: "Die 'Freie Grafschaft Burgund' (Franche-Comté) war einst unter dem Königreich Arles mit dem eigentlichen Burgund vereinigt, ist aber seitdem von uns getrennt und liegt jenseits der Grenze zum Heiligen Römischen Reich. Wir müssen sie zurückfordern, auch wenn wir dabei den Zorn des Kaisers provozieren."
 vn_bur_conquer_romandie_title: "Erobert die Romandie"
 vn_bur_conquer_romandie_desc: "In der Romandie gibt es eine beträchtliche Anzahl französischsprachiger Menschen wie wir. Daher sollte es leicht sein, den Jura zu überqueren und sie als echte burgundische Untertanen zu empfangen."
 vn_bur_subjugate_swiss_title: "Unterwerft die Schweizer"
 vn_bur_subjugate_swiss_desc: "Warum in der Romandie Halt machen, wenn diese Todfeinde, die Schweizer, schwach und inmitten ihrer eigenen kleinlichen Zankereien gespalten sind? Wir müssen die Schweizer zwingen, die burgundische Oberhoheit ein für alle Mal zu akzeptieren."
 vn_bur_bolster_army_title: "Verstärkt die Armee"
 vn_bur_bolster_army_desc: "Burgund erhebt Anspruch auf weite Landstriche, die reif für eine Rückeroberung sind. Um die Expansion Burgunds vorzubereiten, müssen wir eine gewaltige Armee aufstellen, die für diese Aufgabe geeignet ist."
 vn_bur_diplomatic_effort_title: "Diplomatische Bemühungen"
 vn_bur_diplomatic_effort_desc: "Der König der Franken ist nur theoretisch mächtig, so dass wir unseren diplomatischen Einfluss geltend machen und mehr Staaten überzeugen können, sich unserer Sache anzuschließen, um das französische Joch zu brechen."
 vn_bur_acquire_influence_title: "Erlangt Einfluss"
 vn_bur_acquire_influence_desc: "Unsere Nachbarn sind schwach und gespalten, weshalb wir diese Schwächen ausnutzen müssen, indem wir von innen heraus Zwietracht säen. Dann werden unsere Eroberungen viel leichter sein."
 vn_bur_conquer_champagne_title: "Erobert die Champagne"
 vn_bur_conquer_champagne_desc: "Die Champagne ist eine ausgedehnte Region, die aber vor allem für ihren Wein berühmt ist, was sie zu einer wertvollen Ergänzung des burgundischen Territoriums macht. Ihre Eroberung wird uns großen Reichtum und Ansehen bringen."
 vn_bur_subjugate_nevers_title: "Unterwerft Nevers"
 vn_bur_subjugate_nevers_desc: "Nevers ist ein kleiner Staat an der Westgrenze von Burgund, der früher zum Königreich Burgund gehörte. Wir haben also genügend Gründe, ihn als unseren eigenen zu beanspruchen."
 vn_bur_monasteries_of_burgundy_title: "Klöster von Burgund"
 vn_bur_monasteries_of_burgundy_desc: "Das Burgund hat eine starke klösterliche Tradition, die auf die Gründung des Benediktinerordens in der Abtei von Cluny im 10. Jahrhundert zurückreicht. Wir müssen diese Praktiken aufrechterhalten und weitere Klöster gründen, um uns spirituell zu bereichern."
 vn_bur_order_of_golden_fleece_title: "Orden vom Goldenen Vlies"
 vn_bur_order_of_golden_fleece_desc: "Nirgendwo werden die Tugenden des Rittertums so heilig sein wie in Burgund. Mit der Gründung des Ritterordens vom Goldenen Vlies werden wir die Mitgliedschaft nur den angesehensten und angesehensten Rittern des Reiches vorbehalten, damit wir ihre Opfer ehren können."
 vn_bur_assert_independence_title: "Behauptet Unabhängigkeit"
 vn_bur_assert_independence_desc: "Burgund war früher ein starkes und stolzes unabhängiges Königreich aus eigenem Recht, wurde jedoch zum Herzogtum degradiert und seine Territorien wurden im Laufe der vergangenen Jahrzehnte ausgehöhlt. Wir müssen unsere unveräußerliche Souveränität bekräftigen und unsere Abhängigkeit von der französischen Krone verringern, wenn wir überleben wollen."
 vn_bur_expand_wine_trade_title: "Weinhandel ausweiten"
 vn_bur_expand_wine_trade_desc: "Burgund ist eine Region, die für ihre Weine berühmt ist, wie zum Beispiel den hochgeschätzten Chardonnay und Pinot Noir, die zu den Grundpfeilern unserer Wirtschaft gehören. Wir sollten ihren Anbau fördern und sie in Länder in ganz Europa exportieren."
 vn_bur_ducal_palace_title: "Herzoglicher Palast"
 vn_bur_ducal_palace_desc: "Unsere Monarchen brauchen eine große royale Residenz, um die Größe von Burgund und seiner Hauptstadt [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] zu demonstrieren. Zu diesem Zweck sollten wir dort einen Herzogspalast errichten, der die Stadt überragt."
 vn_bur_burgundian_renaissance_title: "Burgundische Renaissance"
 vn_bur_burgundian_renaissance_desc: "Die Renaissance steht vor der Tür, und obgleich wir nicht die ersten sind, die dies getan haben, werden wir die größten Künstler, Musiker und Architekten aus ganz Europa beauftragen, an der Schaffung einer neuen und einzigartigen burgundischen Renaissance mitzuwirken."
 vn_bur_northward_expansion_title: "Beeinflusst die Niederlande"
 vn_bur_northward_expansion.tt: "Hauptstadt befindet sich in der §Yniederländischen§! Überregion"
 vn_bur_northward_expansion_desc: "Damit Burgund wirklich gedeihen kann, müssen wir nach Norden zu den Niederlanden blicken. Auch wenn es weit vom Kernland Burgunds entfernt ist, kann es sich für uns langfristig als vorteilhaft erweisen, Einfluss in der Region zu gewinnen, sei es durch Heirat oder durch Eroberung."
 vn_bur_inheritance_of_flanders_title: "Erbschaft von Flandern"
 vn_bur_inheritance_of_flanders_desc: "Flandern ist ein wohlhabender Staat an der Nordsee und der Neid vieler unternehmungslustiger Staaten. Wenn wir es nicht mit Gewalt erobern können, können wir es vielleicht mit diplomatischeren Mitteln erobern."
 vn_bur_shipyard_of_bruges_title: "Schiffswerft von Brügge"
 vn_bur_shipyard_of_bruges_desc: "Mit einem Zustrom erfahrener portugiesischer Schiffbauer können wir mit dem Bau einer großen Schiffswerft in Brügge beginnen, wo unsere Schiffe den Hafen verlassen und die Reichtümer gebührend zurückfließen werden."
 vn_bur_autonomous_cities_title: "Großes Privileg"
 vn_bur_autonomous_cities_desc: "Wir werden das Große Privileg ausstellen, um die Rechte der aufblühenden Städte der Niederlande zu garantieren und unsere Autorität über eine so große Region wiederherzustellen."

 vn_bur_hook_and_cod_wars_desc: "Die Auseinandersetzungen zwischen den Haken-und-Kabeljau-Fraktionen in Holland dauern schon zu lange an. Wir müssen eine Versöhnung zwischen den beiden Fraktionen erzwingen oder riskieren, dass die Unruhen auf andere Teile der Niederlande übergreifen."
 vn_bur_defeat_france_title: "Besiegt Frankreich"
 vn_bur_defeat_france_desc: "Es ist an der Zeit, unsere ehemaligen Oberherren endlich zu zwingen, in die Knie zu gehen. Indem wir sie angreifen, wenn sie es am wenigsten erwarten, können wir für einen schnellen Sieg sorgen."
 vn_bur_occupy_paris_title: "Besetzt Paris"
 vn_bur_occupy_paris_desc: "Wenn uns die Geschichte etwas gelehrt hat, dann, dass die Einnahme von Paris immer ein schnelles Ende eines Krieges bedeutet. Wir sollten dasselbe tun, aber dieses Mal brennen wir die Stadt nieder!"
 vn_bur_conquer_normandy_title: "Erobert die Normandie"
 vn_bur_conquer_normandy_desc: "Die Normannen sind nach wie vor der Meinung, dass ihr Großherzogtum wirklich einen Herzog benötigen sollte. Vielleicht meinen sie den Herzog von Burgund?"
 vn_bur_claims_in_picardie_title: "Ansprüche in der Picardie"
 vn_bur_claims_in_picardie_desc: "Die Picardie, am östlichen Ende des Ärmelkanals gelegen, wird für unsere Bemühungen um den Aufbau einer gewaltigen Flotte in der Zukunft von entscheidender Bedeutung sein; deshalb müssen wir sie sichern."
 vn_bur_burgundian_fleet_title: "Burgundische Flotte"
 vn_bur_burgundian_fleet_desc: "Unterstützt durch Schiffbaubemühungen anderswo in den Niederlanden werden wir die größte Flotte bauen, die der Ärmelkanal je gesehen hat, und sie nutzen, um unseren Einfluss in die Nordsee und darüber hinaus zu projizieren."
 vn_bur_dominate_the_channel_title: "Dominiert den Ärmelkanal"
 vn_bur_dominate_the_channel_desc: "Die Beherrschung der umliegenden Meere ist unerlässlich, zumal viele unserer einstigen Feinde über eine starke Seefahrertradition verfügen. Lasst uns beweisen, dass wir eine Kraft sind, mit der auf See und im großen Spiel des Handels gerechnet werden muss."
 vn_bur_into_dauphine_title: "In die Dauphiné"
 vn_bur_into_dauphine_desc: "Die Dauphine bewacht viele Pässe durch die Westalpen und ist als solche eine hochstrategische Region, die es zu kontrollieren gilt. Die Übernahme der Bergfestungen wird dafür sorgen, dass unsere Kontrolle über Cisjuranien sicher ist."
 vn_bur_conquer_provence_title: "Erobert die Provence"
 vn_bur_conquer_provence_desc: "Die Provence ist die Schlüsselregion, um im Mittelmeer und den damit verbundenen Reichtümern aus dem Handel mit der Iberischen Halbinsel und Italien Fuß zu fassen. Burgund muss von dieser ergiebigen Quelle des Reichtums profitieren!"
 vn_bur_restore_arles_title: "Arles restaurieren"
 vn_bur_restore_arles_desc: "Die Stadt Arles war einst die große Hauptstadt des gleichnamigen Königreichs, zu dem auch das Burgund gehörte. Nach dem Zusammenbruch des Königreichs ist sie jedoch unter den Grafen der Provence zerfallen; das müssen wir berichtigen und Arles wieder zu einer Stadt machen, die würdig ist, eine echte Hauptstadt für Burgund zu sein."
 vn_bur_duchy_of_bar_title: "Herzogtum Bar"
 vn_bur_duchy_of_bar_desc: "Das Herzogtum Bar wird passenderweise eine Schranke sein, die unsere Länder im Süden und Norden verbindet, und seine strategische Bedeutung wird es uns ermöglichen, sowohl die französische als auch die heilige römische Expansion zu blockieren."
 vn_bur_conquer_lorraine_title: "Erobert Lothringen"
 vn_bur_conquer_lorraine_desc: "Wir müssen erreichen, was die burgundischen Herzöge versäumt haben: die Region Lothringen erobern und unseren Einfluss im Heiligen Römischen Reich weiter ausbauen."
 vn_bur_conquer_alsace_title: "Vorstoß in den Elsass"
 vn_bur_conquer_alsace_desc: "Der Rhein wäre eine ausgezeichnete natürliche Grenze für Burgund. Die Eroberung all der kleinen, unbedeutenden Staaten des Elsass dürfte keine schwierige Aufgabe sein, vorausgesetzt, der Kaiser drückt ein Auge zu."
 vn_bur_conquer_hainaut_title: "Erobert den Hennegau"
 vn_bur_conquer_hainaut_desc: "Der Hennegau liegt am Rande des Heiligen Römischen Reiches und ist dennoch strategisch günstig gelegen, um den französischen Expansionismus im Norden einzudämmen; nutzen wir ihn für uns selbst."
 vn_bur_conquer_luxemburg_title: "Erwerbt Luxemburg"
 vn_bur_conquer_luxemburg_desc: "Die Herrscher Luxemburgs haben sich einen recht guten Ruf erworben, da sie ihre Dynastie weit und breit über ganz Europa verbreitet haben. Leider soll das mit der burgundischen Eroberung enden."
 vn_bur_triumph_over_liege_title: "Triumph über Lüttich"
 vn_bur_triumph_over_liege_desc: "Das Fürstbistum Lüttich weigert sich hartnäckig, den burgundischen Vorrangsanspruch über die Niederlande anzuerkennen; erinnern wir sie daran, wer hier der wahre Lehnsherr ist."
 vn_bur_conquer_brabant_title: "Erobert Brabant"
 vn_bur_conquer_brabant_desc: "Brabant ist das letzte Hindernis, das vor dem Erreichen des Rheins überwunden werden muss. Die Städte Antwerpen und Brüssel werden einen wichtigen Beitrag zu unserer wirtschaftlichen Macht leisten, wenn sie unter unserer Führung stehen."
 vn_bur_bring_holland_to_heel_title: "Besiegt Holland"
 vn_bur_bring_holland_to_heel_desc: "Es war schwierig, Holland zu durchqueren, und das bei all den Deichen und Stürmen, die das Land immer wieder überschwemmen. Aber koste es, was es wolle, wir werden das Zentrum der niederländischen Kultur befrieden und es den burgundischen Niederlanden einverleiben."
 vn_bur_beyond_zuiderzee_title: "Hinter dem Zuiderzee"
 vn_bur_beyond_zuiderzee_desc: "Hinter dem Zuiderzee sind wir den Friesen begegnet, die eher barbarischen Piraten ähneln als den geschäftstüchtigen Holländern im Süden. Lasst sie uns ins Licht der burgundischen Zivilisation rücken und ihre Angriffe auf die ausländische Schifffahrt für immer eindämmen."
 vn_bur_burgundian_netherlands_title: "Burgundische Niederlande"
 vn_bur_burgundian_netherlands_desc: "Die Eroberung der Niederlande war ein durchschlagender Erfolg, aber wir können immer noch weiter gehen und die gesamten Niederlande unterjochen; das kann nur von Vorteil sein."
 vn_bur_conquer_utrecht_title: "Erobert Utrecht"
 vn_bur_conquer_utrecht_desc: "Die Fürstbischöfe von Utrecht haben in der Vergangenheit in den ihrer Gerichtsbarkeit unterstehenden Ländern viel Autonomie ausgeübt, aber das soll mit der burgundischen Herrschaft ein Ende haben. Sie werden sich von jetzt an nur uns gegenüber verantworten."
 vn_bur_annex_gelre_title: "Annektiert Geldern"
 vn_bur_annex_gelre_desc: "Die Grafschaft Geldern ist das Tor zu Friesland und zu Norddeutschland insgesamt. Wir müssen es für uns annektieren."
 vn_bur_consolidate_netherlands_title: "Holländische Konsolidierung"
 vn_bur_consolidate_netherlands_desc: "Die Niederlande müssen zuallererst als burgundisch angesehen werden, indem sie weiter integriert werden; wir können nicht zulassen, dass separatistische Spaltungen unsere Kontrolle über einige der reichsten Gebiete Europas behindern."
 vn_bur_third_kingdom_of_burgundy_title: "Das dritte Königreich"
 vn_bur_third_kingdom_of_burgundy_desc: "Es ist eine schwerwiegende Ungerechtigkeit, dass die Herrscher Burgunds nicht als Könige und Königinnen über bloße Herzöge und Herzoginnen angesehen werden dürfen, vor allem angesichts der Größe unseres Territoriums und des Einflusses, den wir ausüben. Korrigiert dies sofort, mit einer großen Krönung, die in Trier stattfinden wird!"
 vn_bur_seize_savoy_title: "Nehmt Savoyen ein"
 vn_bur_seize_savoy_desc: "Die Region Savoyen bewacht viele wichtige Alpenpässe und würde eine solide natürliche Grenze für Burgund bilden. Wir müssen sie auf Kosten der savoyischen Grafen erobern."
#NORMANDY
 vn_nrm_naval_ventures_title: "Maritime Vorhaben"
 vn_nrm_naval_ventures_desc: "Wir sollten uns ein Beispiel an unseren Vorfahren, den Wikingern, nehmen und mit dem Bau einer Marine beginnen, die beeindruckend genug ist, um unseren Einfluss über die Meere auszudehnen."
 vn_nrm_support_normans_in_italy_title: "Normannen in Italien"
 vn_nrm_support_normans_in_italy_desc: "Seit mindestens 999 landeten Banden normannischer Söldner in Süditalien und stürzten schnell die etablierten Machthaber in der Region, doch ihr Einfluss ist prekär. Wir müssen unsere fernen Brüder mit allen uns zur Verfügung stehenden Mitteln unterstützen."
 vn_nrm_support_normans_in_italy.tt: "Irgendeine Nation in der §Ysizilianischen§! Überregion mit einem Herrscher von §Ynormannischer§! Kultur:\nMeinung von §Y[Root.GetName]§! ist mindestens §Y+125§!."
 vn_nrm_byzantine_bargains_title: "Byzantinische Verhandlungen"
 vn_nrm_byzantine_bargains_desc: "Der Einfluss der Normannen ist weit über unsere Grenzen hinaus spürbar, sogar bis an den byzantinischen Hof. Einige Normannen, wenn auch nur wenige, haben innerhalb ihrer Bürokratie mächtige Positionen gefunden, so dass wir vielleicht mehr von unseren Kriegern im Tausch gegen Münzen versprechen können; die Byzantiner sollten mehr als bereitwillig akzeptieren."
 vn_nrm_claim_maine_title: "Beansprucht Maine"
 vn_nrm_claim_maine_desc: "Die Grafschaft Maine war ein Sprungbrett für feindliche Kräfte wie die Grafen von Anjou, in unser eigenes Gebiet einzufallen. Wir müssen dem einen Riegel vorschieben und Maine für uns beanspruchen."
 vn_nrm_invade_anjou_title: "Einmarsch in Anjou"
 vn_nrm_invade_anjou_desc: "Mit Maine unter unserem Schoß können wir der Grafschaft Anjou den Gefallen erwidern und bis an die Loire vordringen."
 vn_nrm_consolidate_duchy_title: "Konsolidiert das Herzogtum"
 vn_nrm_consolidate_duchy.tt: "Jede eigene Provinz in der §YNormandie§!-Region:\nVerliert §G-10.00%§! lokale Autonomie"
 vn_nrm_consolidate_duchy_desc: "Die Erbfolge von Guillaume II., einem bloßen Bastard, hat zu ernsthaften Auseinandersetzungen und sogar zu regelrechten Rebellionen geführt. Äußere Feinde haben versucht, aus der Situation Kapital zu schlagen, was ihnen auch wieder gelingen könnte. Deshalb müssen wir unsere eigene Position festigen, um nicht unserem eigenen Untergang zum Opfer zu fallen."
 vn_nrm_english_succession_title: "Die englische Thronfolge"
 vn_nrm_english_succession_desc: "Die Frage, wer die Nachfolge auf dem angelsächsischen Thron antreten wird, blieb nach dem Tod des Königs Eadweard III. ungeklärt. Zuvor hatte er den Thron unserem Herzog Guillaume II. versprochen, doch der Graf von Wessex, Hereweald Godwining, hat sich auf empörende Weise angemaßt, was uns rechtmäßig zustehen sollte. Dies darf nicht unangefochten bleiben!"
 vn_nrm_english_succession.tt: "Wir werden Diplomaten in die umliegenden Nationen entsenden und sie bitten, Truppen für unsere Sache zur Verfügung zu stellen."
 vn_nrm_alea_iacta_est_title: "Alea Iacta Est!"
 vn_nrm_alea_iacta_est_desc: "Alea iacta est: die berühmten Worte Caesars beim Überqueren des Rubikons. Wir werden den Ärmelkanal überqueren, um den Kampf zu den Angelsachsen zu bringen und in das Herz ihrer Nation zu schlagen."
 vn_nrm_subjugate_england_title: "Unterwerft England"
 vn_nrm_subjugate_england_desc: "Wir haben jetzt ganz England unter unserer Besatzung, nachdem wir den Usurpator Hereweald abgesetzt haben. Von nun an soll unser Herrscher mit dem Beinamen "der Eroberer" in Erinnerung bleiben - eine glorreiche Ära steht beiden Nationen unter einer Flagge bevor."
 vn_nrm_norman_architecture_title: "Normannische Architektur"
 vn_nrm_norman_architecture_desc: "Die Normannen gehörten zu den frühesten Pionieren der Motten- und Vogtei-Burg, einer steinernen Verteidigungsanlage zum Schutz der Truppen vor Gegenangriffen mit einer schmalen Zugbrücke und einem Graben, der die Burg selbst umgibt und auf einem erhöhten Hügel errichtet wurde. Mit diesem innovativen Konzept werden unsere Festungen uneinnehmbar sein!"
 vn_nrm_safeguard_borders_title: "Absicherung der Grenzen"
 vn_nrm_safeguard_borders_desc: "Wir können uns nur bedingt auf natürliche Verteidigungsanlagen wie die Seine verlassen. Der Bau vieler Burgen in wichtigen Grenzregionen dürfte eine feindliche Invasion erheblich behindern."
 vn_nrm_safeguard_borders.tt: "Habt mindestens §Y3§! Festungen in Grenzprovinzen"
 vn_nrm_conquer_brittany_title: "Erobert die Bretagne"
 vn_nrm_conquer_brittany_desc: "Das Herzogtum Bretagne stellt seit jeher eine Bedrohung für die normannische Integrität dar, sodass es inakzeptabel ist, es als solches bestehen zu lassen. Wir müssen ihnen ein für allemal beweisen, dass die normannische Lebensweise überlegen ist."
 vn_nrm_control_channel_title: "Kontrolliert La Manche"
 vn_nrm_control_channel_desc: "Warum sollte der Ärmelkanal englisch sein, wenn man über die gesamte Küste nur normannische Häfen sehen kann? Lasst uns die vollständige Dominanz dieses lebenswichtigen Handelsnetzes behaupten, das die Nordsee mit dem Atlantik verbindet."
 vn_nrm_control_channel.tt: "Besitzt oder habt einen nichtsouveränen Untertanen, der alle Provinzen besitzt, die an den Ärmelkanal grenzen"
 vn_nrm_conquer_vexin_title: "Fechtet den Vexin an"
 vn_nrm_conquer_vexin_desc: "Der Vexin war schon immer eine Region, die von den französischen Königen auf der einen Seite und den normannischen Herzögen auf der anderen Seite umkämpft war; tatsächlich teilt unsere Grenze die Region in zwei Hälften. Dies ist bestenfalls unbefriedigend, weshalb wir das gesamte Gebiet kontrollieren müssen."
 vn_nrm_claim_ponthieu_title: "Beansprucht Ponthieu"
 vn_nrm_claim_ponthieu_desc: "Die Grafschaft Ponthieu kontrolliert die Passage nördlich nach Calais. Die Beschlagnahmung wird Wege für eine weitere Expansion nach Norden und Osten eröffnen."
 vn_nrm_attack_france_title: "Frankreich herausfordern"
 vn_nrm_attack_france_desc: "Jetzt, da wir genug Macht angesammelt haben, ist es an der Zeit, unsere Stärke gegen die französischen Monarchen zu messen und ihre königliche Macht als Bedrohung auszuschalten, bevor wir selbst der Annexion zum Opfer fallen."
 vn_nrm_support_crusaders_title: "Unterstützt die Kreuzritter"
 vn_nrm_support_crusaders_desc: "Der Papst hat einen Kreuzzug gegen die Sarazenen ausgerufen; wir dürfen die Chance auf eine garantierte Erlösung im Himmel und die Verheißung riesiger Reichtümer, die im Nahen Osten auf uns warten, nicht verpassen!"
 vn_nrm_rule_a_crusader_state_title: "Kreuzritter-\nstaaten"
 vn_nrm_rule_a_crusader_state_desc: "Die Normannen haben sich im Ausland immer wieder als fähige Verwalter erwiesen. Vielleicht lässt sich ihre Reichweite auf die Levante ausdehnen, wo große Führer sehr gefragt sind."

 vn_ase_elect_new_king.tt4: "Diese Mission kann umgangen werden, wenn die Bedingungen nicht erfüllt sind."
 vn_ase_elect_new_king_desc: "The Anglo-Saxon succession is elective rather than strictly hereditary; this gives the Witenagemot power to elect the next king upon the incumbent's death. While Edward the Confessor did have a closer living relative, Edgar Atheling, he was a mere child and so Edward's brother-in-law, Harold Godwinson, became the primary candidate instead. It seems clear that we will need a strong king to steer us through the troubling times ahead, so we must settle with the Witan's decision."

 vn_ase_bretwalda_desc: "In the times of the Heptarchy, the word Bretwalda was used to describe an Anglo-Saxon ruler who had achieved supremacy over the other kingdoms in Great Britain. May the world accord us this title, as we are now the rulers of all Britain!"
 vn_ase_reform_economy_title: "Reformiert die Wirtschaft"
 vn_ase_reform_economy_desc: "While we already have a strong economy through our exports of wool to the rest of Europe in exchange for precious materials such as silver, we should make the most of this and establish new institutions to regulate our economy."

 vn_ase_growth_of_burhs_title: "Wachstum der Burhs"
 vn_ase_growth_of_burhs_desc: "The burh is the traditional Anglo-Saxon town, located within a fortified enclosure; although this design has been beneficial in wartime, in peacetime it is constraining their expansion.

 vn_fri_land_of_monasteries_title: "Land der Klöster"
 vn_fri_land_of_monasteries_desc: "Frisians are known as devout followers of Christ's rule. It should therefore come as no surprise that no region in the Lowlands is shaped by monasteries as much as Frisia. The oldest monasteries emerged in the 9th century as chapters of Augustinians. Later, most of the monasteries were of the order of the Benedictines, Cistercians, Premonstratensians and Franciscans."
 vn_fri_legacy_of_menno_simons_title: "Vermächtnis Menno Simons'"
 vn_fri_legacy_of_menno_simons_desc: "The Reformation didn't go by unnoticed in Frisia. Our lands gave rise to Protestant reformers such as Menno Simons and Obbe Philips. Since then, Frisia largely abandoned Catholicism and instead embraced various Protestant denominations such as Anabaptism, Calvinism and Lutheranism.

 vn_fri_keuren_landrechten_desc: "The 17 Keuren and 24 Landrechten are a collection of texts in which parts of the law and freedoms of Frisia are recorded. The rationale for the written recording of the 17 Keuren and 24 Landrechten lies in the need to make the Frisian privileges known widely, when the royal officials, the counts, are beginning to act as sovereign landlords, thereby threatening our rights."
 vn_fri_upstalsboom_league_title: "Liga des Upstalsboom"
 vn_fri_upstalsboom_league_desc: "Although our lands have long been characterized by the ideals of the Frisian Freedom, this freedom is increasingly being threatened by foreign princes and domestic feuds. In order to provide a more systematic legal system, local leaders should agree and apply rules to all of Frisia. Delegations from all gaue should be sent to annual meetings at the Upstalsboom in Aurich, to judge, to make decisions and, if necessary, to defend our blood-fought autonomy. The delegates should be elected in their home gau at Easter. The meetings can then take place on the Tuesday after Pentecost."

 vn_fri_drenther_crusade_desc: "The Bishop of Utrecht has trouble maintaining his sovereignty over the peasants of Drenthe. To make matters worse, the Drenthers have chosen the path of heresy with occult religious practices.

 vn_fri_redbads_legacy_title: "Radbods Vermächtnis"
 vn_fri_redbads_legacy_desc: "Redbad was the king of Frisia from 680 until his death in 719. He managed to defeat Charles Martel at Cologne, and he is considered to be the greatest king Frisia has ever had, ruling over a kingdom that stretched from the Zwin to the river Weser. We are the proud descendants of this once legendary king. We should restore his legacy and reestablish Frisia as a great power again, respected in the whole of Europe and beyond."
 vn_fri_confirm_karelsprivilege_title: "Bestätigt das Karelsprivilege"
 vn_fri_confirm_karelsprivilege_desc: "The Karelsprivilege is a privilege that Charlemagne has bestowed on us in gratitude for the support we gave in the capture of Rome. The privilege is the basis of the Frisian Freedom. We are not ruled by a foreign count or duke, but we rule ourselves. We should remind the Holy Roman Emperor of this privilege."

 vn_fri_unify_middle_frisia_desc: "Known as Middle Frisia, the area between the Vlie and the river Ems, from Westergo to Oldambt, used to be the political centre of the medieval Frisian realm. We should unite the Frisians living in this part of Frisia."

 vn_fri_frisian_freedom_desc: "All of Frisia, from the Vlie to the Weser, must be united to prevent any foreign prince claiming any of the Frisian lands as his own, threatening the freedoms our people have long enjoyed and continue to enjoy. We Frisians only owe our allegiance to the Holy Roman Emperor."
 vn_fri_subjugate_groningen_title: "Unterwerft Groningen"
 vn_fri_subjugate_groningen_desc: "Originally a small Saxon village, the city of Groningen has become an important trade centre in the last few centuries. Although legally under the authority of the Bishop of Utrecht, the city defied his rule and started acting like a free imperial city, although not formally recognized by the Emperor. Groningen has now turned its eyes on our lands, greatly increasing their influence in the Ommelanden, presenting itself as a Frisian city and as a defender of the Frisian Freedom! If they want to be a Frisian city so badly, we should formally integrate them in our nation."
 vn_fri_reclaim_west_frisia_title: "Beansprucht Westfriesland"
 vn_fri_reclaim_west_frisia_desc: "The county of Holland used to be called West Frisia, a reminder that these lands once belonged to the Frisian realm. The abandonment of their Frisian roots was completed by adopting the language of Low Franconian. Only in the north, Westflinge, Frisians hold on to their language, leading to countless attempts to subdue them to the rule of the count. Since then the counts of Holland have been a threat to our sovereignty. It is time to remind them of their roots and call these lands West Frisia again!"
 vn_fri_reconquer_trecht_title: "Erobert Trecht zurück"
 vn_fri_reconquer_trecht_desc: "The center of power of the early medieval Frisian kingdom was the city of Trecht, later renamed to Utrecht. Trecht was founded by the Romans as Traiectum. Later, Trecht became a matter of dispute between the Franks and the Frisians. Trecht is strategically located, giving control of important trade routes on the Rhine to the North Sea. Nowadays, Utrecht is the seat of the Bishop of Utrecht. It is time to once again claim our natural capital and restore Utrecht to its former glory."
 vn_fri_unify_east_frisia_title: "Vereint Ostfriesland"
 vn_fri_unify_east_frisia_desc: "Between the rivers Ems and Weser lie the lands of the East Frisians, known for, among other things, hosting the annual Upstalsboom gatherings. Our people even colonized a strip of land on the other side of the Weser, known as Wursten. We should unite the Frisians living in this part of Frisia."
 vn_fri_develop_emden_title: "Entwickelt Emden"
 vn_fri_develop_emden_desc: "Emden was founded in around 800 as a small trading settlement on a mound on the Ems, connecting it to upstream towns and cities. Emden has great potential to become an important port, connecting Frisia to the trade routes in the North Sea and Baltic Sea, enabling our merchants and skippers to once again play an important role in international trade."
 vn_fri_develop_wetlands_title: "Erschließt die Feuchtgebiete"
 vn_fri_develop_wetlands_desc: "The North Sea has been our greatest friend and our most feared enemy at the same time. Although she gave us easy access to foreign markets, the sea has flooded our lands countless times, resulting in the drowning of tens of thousands of people and catastrophic material damage. We should build dykes to protect the coastal areas, giving us a chance to increase agricultural production in the many fertile coastal lands Frisia offers."
 vn_fri_liberate_north_frisia_title: "Befreit Nordfriesland"
 vn_fri_liberate_north_frisia_desc: "Centuries ago, Frisians settled on Helgoland and the islands of the Uthlande. More recently, the coastal marshlands of the mainland were also colonized. By establishing trade relations with East Anglia and controlling the salt trade, the North Frisians grew prosperous. Nowadays however, Danish kings try to claim sovereignty over the North Frisians. We should come to the aid of our brothers in the North and reunite them with the rest of Frisia. No Frisian should be subjected to foreign rule!"
 vn_fri_north_sea_whaling_title: "Walfang in der Nordsee"
 vn_fri_north_sea_whaling_desc: "With the onset of whaling, the people from the Uthlande in North Frisia have developed a reputation of being very skilled mariners, and most Dutch and English whaling ships bound for Greenland and Svalbard have a crew of North Frisian islanders. On the island of Feer alone, roughly a quarter of the inhabitants are whalers. North Frisian seamen continue to serve foreign whaling companies. Maybe we should set up a whaling company as well so that they can serve Frisian interests."
 vn_fri_rebuild_dorestad_title: "Wiederaufbau von Dorestad"
 vn_fri_rebuild_dorestad_desc: "Dorestad was an early medieval emporium in the early medieval kingdom of Frisia. It flourished during the 8th to early 9th centuries as one of the most important trading posts in Northwestern Europe, due to its proximity to the fork in the Rhine, with easy access to all surrounding areas. Persistent Viking raids and the decline of international trade in favor of regional trade led to the downfall of Dorestad as an important trading hub. With Dorestad once again in Frisian hands and with the growing importance of international trade we should restore this town to its former glory."
 vn_fri_found_rustringen_title: "Gründet Rüstringen"
 vn_fri_found_rustringen_desc: "Lying at the mouth of the river Weser, the gau of Rüstringen is often subject to devastating floods, resulting in the creation of the Jadebusen. We should organize the construction of dikes, paving the way for the foundation of the city of Rüstringen. This will give us an opportunity to control the trade with the upstream city of Bremen and it will also strengthen our position as a naval power."

 vn_fri_mare_frisicum.tt: "No country in the §YNorth Germany§!, §YScandinavia§!, §YLowlands§! or §YBritain§! Superregion has a navy larger than ours."
 vn_fri_mare_frisicum_desc: "The North Sea was once called 'Mare Frisicum'. This name reminds us of the Early Middle Ages, a period which was marked by the rule of, among others, the legendary king Redbad, and in which Frisian merchants maintained and ruled an extensive network of important Northern European trade routes. These trade routes even went as far as Sigtuna and Novgorod. We should do everything we can to restore our position as a maritime power and reestablish Mare Frisicum."
 vn_fri_colonize_peatlands_title: "Besiedelt das Moorland"
 vn_fri_colonize_peatlands_desc: "The peatlands have long remained inhospitable areas, leaving them mostly uninhabited until now. Recent technological improvements, however, have enabled us to settle in these lands. The peatlands have a valuable thing to offer: peat, a great source of fuel and a valued product in the ever growing cities of Frisia.  We should set up colonies where workers can excavate the peatlands for peat production."

#BURGUNDY
 vn_missions.52.t: "A New Capital?"
 vn_missions.52.d: "The city of Arles was once one of the most important cities in southern France, being the seat of the kings of Arles, a kingdom created out of a merger of the former kingdoms of Lower and Upper Burgundy in 933. However, after the death of the nominal king of Arles, Rodolph III, in 1032 without issue, the kingdom passed to the Holy Roman Emperors, and it thus ceased to play a major political role. Several duchies broke away from the kingdom, such as Provence, Dauphine and even our own duchy in Burgundy. This has led to the rapid decline in power and prestige of the city.\nHowever, with Cisjurania, Transjurania, Provence and Burgundy now under our firm control, we can once again claim to be the rightful successors of the this historic kingdom. To celebrate the reunification of these territories, we should move the capital to its rightful place."

The event has sent shockwaves throughout Europe and will irrevocably alter the balance of power, now that a king with territory stretching from Amsterdam to Arles has been officially recognized by an emperor. We must waste no time in reaping the prestige and foreign praise this coronation has given us!"

Being threatened on all sides by enemies, the Byzantines have utilized elite units such as the Varangian Guard, who are fiercely loyal to the [BYZ.Monarch.GetTitle].

 vn_missions.55.d: "Tensions are brewing as the Norman [NRM.Monarch.GetTitle] [NRM.Monarch.GetName] has made clear his intention to seize the English throne by force if necessary, claiming that the late king Eadweard promised him the throne. Now, he is reaching out to other reputable dukedoms across the land requesting soldiers to fight the inevitable war to come.\nToday, a Norman diplomat arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] asking for our contribution. They claim their cause has even been sanctioned by the Pope himself, but we have yet to respond. How should we proceed, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"

Im Jahr 801 wurde die Grafschaft Barcelona übernommen und der Marca Hispanica unterstellt, doch nach dem Tod Karls des Großen wurden die katalanischen Staaten zunehmend unabhängiger von fränkischen Angelegenheiten.\nEin Wendepunkt in der Geschichte der Grafschaft geschah im Jahr 985, als muslimische Truppen unter Almanzor Barcelona plünderten. Graf Borrell II. sandte ein Hilfeersuchen an den französischen König Lothar III., das jedoch abgelehnt wurde. Nach der Thronbesteigung von Hugo Capet zum König von Frankreich sandte Borrell jedoch erneut ein Hilfeersuchen, das schließlich beantwortet wurde, aber die Adeligen von Hugo weigerten sich, eine Expedition nach Iberien zu unterstützen. Dadurch wurde die Verbindung zwischen Frankreich und Barcelona fast endgültig gekappt.\nObwohl wir an der Seite der anderen katalanischen Grafschaften mit viel größerer Unabhängigkeit handeln konnten, bleibt die Tatsache bestehen, dass wir de jure Vasallen des Königs von Frankreich sind. Mit der jüngsten Aufstockung unseres Militärs haben wir jedoch unsere Unabhängigkeit von der Krone vorerst endgültig behauptet."
 vn_missions.62.a: "Barcelona soll frei sein!"

 vn_missions.63.t: "Der Stein von Scone"
 vn_missions.63.d: "Der Stein von Scone, seit Jahrhunderten ein Grundpfeiler der Krönungszeremonie für schottische Könige, ist nun in unsere Hände gefallen, nachdem er aus der Abtei von Scone geplündert wurde. Der Besitz dieses unschätzbaren Artefakts wird zweifellos unsere Ansprüche auf das schottische Reich stärken und unser Ansehen erhöhen. In der Zwischenzeit können wir den Stein für die Krönung unserer eigenen Könige gut gebrauchen."
 vn_missions.63.a: "Prachtvoll!"
#MILAN
 vn_missions.64.t: "Promotion to Duchy!"
 vn_missions.64.d: "After much consideration, the ruling Emperor $EMPERORNAME$ has agreed to elevate Milan to a duchy, but at a sizeable cost. Once we are crowned, our position in the political stage will transform from a mere local power among many into a burgeoning Italian powerhouse."
 vn_missions.64.d2: "As the current Emperor, we in theory possess a great deal of authority across swathes of Central Europe, but the lowly position of our home territory diminishes our legitimacy to rule an empire. Thankfully, we can use our authority to invest ourselves as the Dukes of Milan without the chance of resistance from outside powers."
 vn_missions.64.a: "A handsome title indeed!"
 vn_missions.64.b: "And so we shall!"
 vn_missions.65.t: "The Swiss Offer Assistance"
 vn_missions.65.d: "Swiss mercenaries are renowned for their prowess on the battlefield, and have been hired across Europe in countless wars. As it so happens, we have managed to secure a favorable contract with one of the Swiss states, offering a sizeable portion of highly disciplined mercenaries in exchange for some coin. In our time of great need, this could be the force to turn the tide of the ongoing war in our favor."
 vn_missions.65.a: "Fight for your new masters!"
#LORRAINE
 vn_missions.68.t: "The Capital of Lotharingia"
 vn_missions.68.d: "Now that the kingdom of Lotharingia has once again been revived, a decision must be taken as to where the nation's capital should be.\n[2995.GetName], the former political center of Charlemagne's empire, is one such candidate. In order to assert our claim to the rest of the empire he once held, we could relocate to the city.\nHowever, to appeal to our own history we could move the capital to [34.GetName], given that it was the capital of the former Kingdom of Lotharingia.\nAlternatively, the city of [869.GetName], the historical seat of the dukes of Lorraine, could also be a suitable capital. Which city shall we move to?"
 vn_missions.68.a: "[2995.GetName], the center of the Frankish Empire!"
 vn_missions.68.b: "[34.GetName], the birthplace of the Carolingians!"
 vn_missions.68.c: "[869.GetName], the seat of the dukes of Lorraine!"
 vn_missions.68.e: "We will stick with [Root.Capital.GetName]."
#NITRA/SLOVAKIA
 vn_missions.69.t: "[From.GetName] Requests a Union"
 vn_missions.69.d: "Recently, the [From.GetAdjectiveCap]s have admitted themselves into the Holy Roman Empire, seemingly to protect themselves against the threat of the Magyars and Poles on both sides. But they may not be secure enough, as an ambassador has reached the [Root.GetAdjectiveCap] court with a request from [From.Monarch.GetName] requesting a union of the states of [From.GetName] and [Root.GetName]. While the union appears to be beneficial to us both, it could also risk compromising our national sovereignty."
 vn_missions.69.a: "We have no choice but to accept."
 vn_missions.69.b: "Their offer is outrageous!"
 vn_missions.70.t: "Reestablishment of Great Moravia"
 vn_missions.70.d: "For centuries, Great Moravia has been a distant, long-forgotten ancestor to many West Slavic states. First known to have existed in 833, it was centered around the Morava river which gave the principality its name. Under its rulers Mojmir and Rastislav, the state expanded outwards to reach its maximum extent under Svatopluk 'the Great', which included parts of Moravia, Bohemia, Slovakia and Pannonia, and even as far as Ruthenia. Although it was once no more, now that we hold the heartlands of Great Moravia, we can claim to be their successors; a prestigious feat indeed."
 vn_missions.70.a: "Endless Glory!"
#FRANCE
 vn_missions.61.t: "The Batavian Question"
 vn_missions.61.d: "Our conquest of the Netherlands in its entirety has taken Europe by storm and shown the military superiority of the French. Now under martial law for the time being to keep control over a people who not just speak a different language, but in some cases practice a different faith to ours, the question still remains as to what to do with the Dutch institutions of government that still de jure exist.\nWe could either restore a Dutch republic or a Dutch monarchy, both of which would remain puppet states to us, or choose to continue centralized rule in the territories with an iron fist; this last option, though, is likely to provoke much resistance from the subjugated Dutch."
 vn_missions.61.a: "Create the Batavian Republic"
 vn_missions.61.b: "Create the Batavian Kingdom"
 vn_missions.61.c: "Continue ruling them from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]"
 vn_missions.72.t: "March on [2235.GetCapitalName]"
 vn_missions.72.d: "Our unstoppable march through Italy has culminated in the historic occupation of [2235.GetCapitalName], the seat of the Popes and a beacon of civilization. With the city finally in our hands, we can claim to be hegemons of the Italian peninsula, but one crucial question still remains. The city's riches and countless artifacts have not gone ignored by those in command of our armies, which by now are eager to be rewarded for their exploits.\nWe must either plunder the city and seize its wealth for ourselves, which would almost certainly provoke the ire of Catholic states, or take a harsh stance against looting; this, however, would almost certainly be a detriment to morale."
 vn_missions.72.a: "We have crossed the Rubicon, and now this great city must fall."
 vn_missions.72.a.tt: "Every country recognizing the Pope loses §R25§! opinion of us."
 vn_missions.72.b: "The city must not be sacked, God willing!"
 vn_missions.76.t: "Fate of the Holy Roman Empire"
 vn_missions.76.da: "With the ascension of [Root.GetMonarchName] as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, [Root.GetName] shall experience a new era of prosperity that will reflect on the empire as a whole which we control. The tyrannical unjust rule of the previous emperor now thrown off, the remaining states of the Empire are more than willing to come under our protection."
 vn_missions.76.db: "With the destruction of the Holy Roman Empire, its former legacy of creating confusing borders has been consigned to a footnote in history as we herald a new era of prosperity. Having overcome the major obstacle to [Root.GetAdjective] expansion, we are now more able than ever to move our armies further east and claim more land for the glorious [FRA.GetName]."
 vn_missions.76.a: "The Holy Roman Empire will shine once more!"
 vn_missions.76.b: "The Holy Roman Empire is no more!"
#DENMARK
 vn_missions.51.t: "The Dannebrog"
 vn_missions.51.d: "The Dannebrog, now adopted as Denmark's national flag, has long been connected to a legend of a miraculous event that took place at the Battle of Lindanise on June 15, 1219. The Danes, who had joined the Livonian Crusade, met the forces of two Estonian tribes at Lindanise, later known as Reval. During the battle, they were surprised by the Estonians attacking their fortress from five different angles, and looked to be overwhelmed until a red flag with a white cross (the Dannebrog) fell from the sky, giving the Danes renewed hope. They then counterattacked and routed the Estonians.\nThis legend, regardless of its truth, has cemented the Dannebrog as a national icon and a source of great prestige for generations to come."
 vn_missions.51.a: "Great!"
 vn_missions.79.t: "The Kalmar Union"
 vn_missions.79.d: "The Kalmar Union was a personal union between the kingdoms of Denmark, Norway and Sweden that lasted from 1397-1523, albeit with brief interruptions. Its formation was largely a reaction to the influence of the Hanseatic League to the south. The three countries were ruled by the Danish monarch, who wanted a strong, centralized state, but this clashed with the Swedish and Norwegian nobility, who wanted to retain a degree of independence. To appease these nobles, we could delegate our conquered lands to them, or go against their wishes and continue ruling directly from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 vn_missions.79.a: "Institute the Union!"
 vn_missions.79.b: "We don't need more meddlesome subjects"
 vn_missions.79.b.tt: "Every §YNorwegian§! and §YSwedish§! core in the §YScandinavia§! superregion gets '§YDirect Rule§!' for §Y25 years§!, giving the following effects:\nLocal Unrest: §R+8.00§!\nLocal Autonomy: §G-0.03§!"
#SWEDEN
 vn_missions.59.t: "Restoring the Temple at Uppsala"
 vn_missions.59.d: "The Uppsala Temple has long been a religious center of the Ásatrú faith, made famous in Europe by the descriptions of Adam of Bremen who wrote during the 1070s. He describes a huge temple adorned with gold and the statues of the gods Thor, Odin and Freyr, even if this may be quite far from the truth. Indeed, the temple itself has been falling into disrepair during the past few decades as religious turmoil between the Ásatrú and Catholics has gripped [Root.GetName].\nHowever, now that we have stabilized the situation and brought our fellow [Root.Religion.GetName] adherents to the fore, we could renovate the temple and make it a true [Root.Religion.GetName] place of worship."
 vn_missions.59.a: "We must restore this invaluable piece of our heritage!"

 vn_missions.75.d: "In the ongoing war between [Root.GetName] and [2268.Owner.GetName], the control of one city may decide it more than any other: [2268.GetCapitalName]. Situated near the mouth of the River Thames, it has been easy prey for Viking raiders in the past. Normally the city would be well-defended, but with our naval superiority against the foe we were able to circumvent the walls and launch an amphibious attack.\nWhat followed would be carnage and destruction on a scale [2268.GetCapitalName] had never seen before. With the city now in our hands, and our coffers significantly enlarged, the tide of the war will no doubt swing in our favor; its loss has dealt a severe blow to the [2268.Owner.GetAdjective] forces still fighting against us.\nAs for [2268.GetCapitalName] itself, it will almost certainly not fully recover for quite some time. The question is how far we want to scorch the earth; perhaps the city will still be useful both economically and politically, but we will have to accept the destruction already sustained from the raid regardless."
 vn_missions.75.a: "Give no quarter and take no prisoners!"
 vn_missions.75.b: "Let [2268.GetCapitalName] be looted, but be merciful."
 vn_missions.75.c: "The city could be useful to us later; leave it be."

 vn_missions.77.d: "In the year of our Lord, [GetYear], the Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] has agreed to finally recognize us as the true sovereigns of the Kingdom of Portugal. The papal bull reads as follows:\n\n...to the most beloved son in Christ, [Root.Monarch.GetName], Illustrious [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the Portuguese, and to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heirs, in perpetuity:\n\nIt is clearly demonstrated that, as a good son and catholic prince, you have rendered innumerable services to your mother, the Holy Church, intrepidly exterminating through hardships and military prowess the enemies of the Christian name and diligently propagating the Christian faith, thereby leaving to generations still unborn a name worthy of memory and an example deserving of imitation...\n\nWe, therefore, because of your qualities of prudence, justice and idoneity for government, take you under the protection of Saint Peter and our own, and grant and confirm by apostolic authority to your excellent domain, the Kingdom of Portugal, full honors of kingdom and the dignity that befits kings, as well as all places which, with the help of the Celestial Grace, you have wrested from the hands of the Saracens, and to which your neighboring Christian princes may not claim any rights...\n\nWith the Papacy now guaranteeing our rights to kingship, this will surely be an upset for any of our neighbors seeking to bring us back under their yoke."
 vn_missions.77.a: "Brilliant!"
#SPAIN
 vn_missions.78.t: "Sack of [2235.GetCapitalName]"
 vn_missions.78.d: "On [GetDate], [2235.GetCapitalName] was rocked by a tragedy that has shocked the Catholic world and brought destruction to the heart of the city, which according to our recent reports was the work of disgruntled mercenaries and landsknechts allegedly under our employ.\nHaving gone without pay for some time, the mercenaries, many of whom had anti-Papist sentiments, marched on the heart of the Holy See and the home of Christianity. The Roman garrison had merely 5,000 defenders plus 189 of the famed Swiss Guard. Early on, any sort of organized command among the attackers broke down and they overpowered the outnumbered defense, slaughtering them in their last stand and stripping the city bare of loot.\nNow with news of the atrocity spreading to courts across Europe, our reputation is in jeopardy with many seeing the attack as a way to further our expansionist ambitions."
 vn_missions.78.a: "Actually, I quite like this reputation we have!"
 vn_missions.78.b: "Use all our diplomatic efforts to soften the blow."

 vn_missions.80.d: "Friedrich von Schrötter sagte einmal: "Preußen war kein Staat mit einer Armee, sondern eine Armee mit einem Staat". Entlang dieser Denkweise ist eine Armee entstanden, die sich von allen anderen in Europa unterscheidet und den Ruf von Professionalität und Disziplin auf dem Schlachtfeld gefestigt hat.\nTraditionell haben es unsere Generäle vorgezogen, den Feind auf dem Schlachtfeld mit entscheidenden Siegen zu schlagen, anstatt langwierige Belagerungen durchzuführen, aber diese Doktrin wird zunehmend in Frage gestellt, da unsere Feinde stärkere Festungen einsetzen, um unseren Vormarsch zu verlangsamen. Sollten wir unsere seit langem bestehende Doktrin des "Bewegungskrieges" bekräftigen oder unsere Taktik ändern und uns auf Zermürbungskriege konzentrieren?"

 vn_missions.81.d: "The centers of power of the early medieval Frisian kingdom were the city of Trecht, nowadays the seat of the Bishop of Utrecht, and the now perished city of Dorestad, once one of the most important trading hubs in northwestern Europe. With both cities back in Frisian hands, it is time for us to decide if we should relocate our center of power back to one of these cities."
 vn_missions.81.a: "Trecht should be our new capital!"

 vn_missions.82.d: "Now that we have a greater presence in the lands surrounding the North Sea, many foreign legends and folk tales reach our shores. According to one of these legends there exists a colony of Frisians on the southern tip of the distant Faroese island of Suðuroy.\nThe legend says a group of Frisians left their homeland when it was conquered by Charles Martel in 734. With dragon boats they became pirates just like the Danes and captured many loads in the seaports of the Baltic. One day the fleet was dispersed by a storm and one of the ships landed on Suðuroy. Here the Frisians were given the southern edge of the island, where they founded the colony of Akraberg. It is said that they remained heathens a long time after the rest of the Faroe Islands were Christianized."

We could exact our retribution for centuries of English domination by reducing it to a ruin, or become masters of a new Irish capital if we so choose. The choice is yours, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
