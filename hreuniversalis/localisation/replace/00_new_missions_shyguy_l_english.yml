 russian_factionalism.1.t: "Factionalism of the Rus"
 russian_factionalism.1.d: "Despite abolishing the Rota System, which has regulated successions in the Russian Principalities based on a seniority principle until recently, the everlasting and advancing enmity within the Russian Princes was not resolved. Even though inheritance in the individual Principalities is now determined by primogeniture, spurned Princes continue to raise claims to the most powerful and wealthy Principalities in Rus.\n\nThus, the once strong and united Kievan Rus has evolved into a warring state, where individual branches of the Rurikid dynasty are fighting and slaying each other to enforce their putative claims. It is uncertain whether [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] will exercise the necessary authority to appease and restrain his subject kinsmen when they will be simultaneously disputing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] coveted Grand Princely Throne..."
 russian_factionalism.1.d2: "Sticking to the Rota System, which regulates successions in the Russian Principalities based on a seniority principle, proved to be a severe mistake over the long term. Each death of a Prince meant that potentially every title in Rus had to be enfeoffed anew, often leaving the direct descendants of the deceased Prince with only worthless Principalities or, in the worst case, none at all.\n\nThus, the once strong and united Kievan Rus has evolved into a warring state, where individual branches of the Rurikid dynasty are fighting and slaying each other to enforce their putative claims. It is uncertain whether [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] will exercise the necessary authority to appease and restrain his subject kinsmen when they will be simultaneously disputing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] coveted Grand Princely Throne..."

 russian_factionalism.2.d: "A powerful magnate of [kiev_reb_prov.GetAreaName], dissatisfied with our rule, has approached us with a demand to be allowed to rule his lands with greater autonomy. He claims that if we do not agree, we can no longer rely on him as a loyal vassal. Should we give in?"

 russian_factionalism.2.b: "We must not turn him into our enemy."
 russian_factionalism.3.t: "Tmutarakan strives for Independence"
 russian_factionalism.3.d: "The Principality of Tmutarakan has always represented a coveted object of contention among Russian princes, thanks to the immense wealth generated by its location on the Black Sea; we have profited from it in the past as well. The magnates of the Principality fear that they will soon become a pawn between us and the other appanages, demanding the cancellation of our feudal contract immediately.

 russian_factionalism.4.d: "Poland had long been played an important role for trade for the Kievan Rus, as land routes to Western Europe run through it. However, with growing factionalism in recent decades, the Princes of Volhynia have increasingly alienated from us and instead moved steadily towards the Polish rulers.

According to his statement, he was tired of his uncle's subservience to the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName], which he considered unacceptable for the Principality.\nHe now demands that we recognize him as an independent Prince of Vladimir.

 russian_factionalism.6.d: "The Principalities of Kiev, Pereyaslavl and Chernigov have been the political and cultural leaders of the entire East Slavic world since the rule of Yaroslav the Wise, who bequeathed these three Principalities to his sons.

 russian_factionalism.8.d: "[rand_appa.Monarch.GetTitle] [rand_appa.Monarch.GetName] and the magnates of [rand_appa.GetName], feeling neglected and oppressed by decades of an allegedly miserable rule on our part, have called for an uprising against us. We must accommodate them if we want to defuse the dire situation and preserve our rule."

 russian_factionalism.8.b: "Inundate them with gifts."
 russian_factionalism.9.t: "Factionalism Spreads"
 russian_factionalism.9.d: "With the current infighting between the Princes of the Kievan Rus, lesser Princes are taking the opportunity to revolt in some places and demand their independence from their liege lords.\nOne of these Princes, whose core territory has since been in [rus_mag_prov.GetName], has yielded questionable documents purporting to prove his claim to surrounding cities and provinces. Regardless, we are currently unable to prevent this from happening."
 russian_factionalism.9.a: "Worrying."
 russian_factionalism.10.t: "Unwilling to Fight"
 russian_factionalism.10.d: "There is displeasure in many of our regiments of our army over our recent campaigns, as they have been loss-making and often hardly decisive of our objectives.

With shame and humiliation, we will have to defend what remains to us."
 russian_factionalism.100.d2: "The worst times of fragmentation are finally over; And have proven our untamed might as the rightful Grand Prince of the Rus. Our enemies were numerous and often among our own ranks, but ultimately we were able to defeat them all to the point that they will no longer pose a threat to us in the near future.\nThe [Root.GetAdjective] Grand Principality shall arise again!"
