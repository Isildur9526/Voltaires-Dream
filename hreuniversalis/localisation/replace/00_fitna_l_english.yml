 great_fitna.1.d: "Dynastic decadence, social and religious tensions and political failures led to a series of uprisings in the [Root.GetAdjective] Caliphate. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must bring these issues under [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] control in order to prevent a permanent collapse of the Caliphate.\nSome of our viziers regard this as a divine trial to challenge our Caliphate.

But with the diminishing influence we exert on this region, [HED.Monarch.GetSheHe] was no longer able to stop Sunni preachers and missionaries from evangelizing in [HED.Monarch.GetHerHis] realm.\nIf we were to lose the holiest sites of Islam, it would be a severe blow to our Caliphal authority. We must restore the rightful faith in Hejaz!"

 great_fitna.9.d: "Reports of violent clashes within our army are becoming increasingly frequent - especially between Turkish mamluks on the one hand and Sudanese, Berber or Syrian soldiers on the other.
