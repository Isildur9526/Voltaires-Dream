 livestock: "Cattle"
 grain: "Wheat"
 tobacco: "Inhalants"
 chinaware: "Ceramics"
 tobaccoDESC: "Inhalants encompass various recreational smoking materials such as opium and tobacco. While opium was known to the Islamic world for centuries and grown throughout Persia, tobacco was first brought from the Americas in the late 16th century. It quickly became a fashion for the upper classes who could afford it and ensured the fast and profitable economic growth of their colonies. No one knew what they put in it, but, like opium, they just couldn't stop smoking it."
 chinawareDESC: "Ceramics represents various exotic vessels such as chinaware and decorative pottery. Generally from the Orient, these high value luxuries command a high price on the market."
 livestockDESC: "Since the dawn of history, the care for domesticated animals has been one of the main occupations of humanity. Cattle includes everything from cows and oxen in rich agricultural areas to the herds of pastoralists in the great plains and deserts of the world."
 grainDESC: "Wheat represents the vegetable foodstuff that was the staple diet for humans and animals. Lack of it would always lead to revolts and riots. Other cereals and vegetable foodstuffs would later be augmented by tomatoes, corn, and even potatoes from America offering a wider choice both in food and agricultural production varieties."
 gemsDESC: "Since the earliest times, stones such as rubies, sapphires, diamonds, emeralds, jade, or amber, have been used in jewelry and ceremonial attire. For centuries the only source of diamonds in the world were the fabled mines at Golconda. While not all precious stones are as rare, they are all highly sought after commodities."

 sugarDESC: "Sugar was used not only as a sweetener but also for food preservation. The sugar cane was the only known means of obtaining sugar at this time and had been grown initially in some Mediterranean islands. In later centuries, production shifted to the New World, but the original plantations continued to operate in Europe."
 spicesDESC: "Spices were known in Europe since ancient times, mostly for their medicinal value, and for their ability to improve the taste of food. Saffron, ginger, nutmeg, chili, cinnamon, etc. came partly from East Africa but mostly from India, China, and the Spice Islands (current Indonesia), to be traded in Alexandria or the other terminals of the great caravan roads. The European desire for cheaper and more direct supply constituted the main motivation for the very first eastbound sea voyages of discoveries for Portugal."
 naval_suppliesDESC: "Naval Supplies represent everything needed in ship construction, including ropes, linen, sails, and various other materials. The Baltic was initially the main supplier until North America became an alternate source of supply in the early 18th century.
